## How It Works 💻

1. **Home Screen**: The app starts with an automatic sliding banner featuring the latest movies. Below that, it shows a genres listing, followed by multiple movie sections like "Now Playing", "Popular Movies", "Discover", and "Upcoming Movies".
2. **Genres Listing**: Each genre features a scrollable list of movies displayed using **LazyColumn** and **Paging 3** for seamless pagination.
3. **Movie Details**: Click on a movie to see details like its name, description, language, rating, and more. You’ll also see related movies in the same genre.
4. **Search**: Use the search option to find any movie directly from the server.
5. **Wishlist**: Add your favorite movies to the wishlist using **Room Database** and swipe to remove them easily.

## Libraries Used 📚
